"""Helpers for grpc communication with a Starlink user terminal.

This module contains functions for getting the history and status data and
either return it as-is or parsed for some specific statistics, as well as a
handful of functions related to dish control.

The history and status functions return data grouped into sets, as follows.

Note:
    Functions that return field names may indicate which fields hold sequences
    (which are not necessarily lists) instead of single items. The field names
    returned in those cases will be in one of the following formats:

    : "name[]" : A sequence of indeterminate size (or a size that can be
        determined from other parts of the returned data).
    : "name[n]" : A sequence with exactly n elements.
    : "name[n1,]" : A sequence of indeterminate size with recommended starting
        index label n1.
    : "name[n1,n2]" : A sequence with n2-n1 elements with recommended starting
        index label n1. This is similar to the args to range() builtin.

    For example, the field name "foo[1,5]" could be expanded to "foo_1",
    "foo_2", "foo_3", and "foo_4" (or however else the caller wants to
    indicate index numbers, if at all).

General status data
-------------------
This group holds information about the current state of the user terminal.

: **id** : A string identifying the specific user terminal device that was
    reachable from the local network. Something like a serial number.
: **hardware_version** : A string identifying the user terminal hardware
    version.
: **software_version** : A string identifying the software currently installed
    on the user terminal.
: **state** : As string describing the current connectivity state of the user
    terminal. One of: "UNKNOWN", "CONNECTED", "BOOTING", "SEARCHING", "STOWED",
    "THERMAL_SHUTDOWN", "NO_SATS", "OBSTRUCTED", "NO_DOWNLINK", "NO_PINGS".
: **uptime** : The amount of time, in seconds, since the user terminal last
    rebooted.
: **snr** : Most recent sample value. See bulk history data for detail.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides this data.
: **seconds_to_first_nonempty_slot** : Amount of time from now, in seconds,
    until a satellite will be scheduled to be available for transmit/receive.
    See also *scheduled* in the bulk history data. May report as a negative
    number, which appears to indicate unknown time until next satellite
    scheduled and usually correlates with *state* reporting as other than
    "CONNECTED".
: **pop_ping_drop_rate** : Most recent sample value. See bulk history data for
    detail.
: **downlink_throughput_bps** : Most recent sample value. See bulk history
    data for detail.
: **uplink_throughput_bps** : Most recent sample value. See bulk history data
    for detail.
: **pop_ping_latency_ms** : Most recent sample value. See bulk history data
    for detail.
: **alerts** : A bit field combining all active alerts, where a 1 bit
    indicates the alert is active. See alert detail status data for which bits
    correspond with each alert, or to get individual alert flags instead of a
    combined bit mask.
: **fraction_obstructed** : The fraction of total area (or possibly fraction
    of time?) that the user terminal has determined to be obstructed between
    it and the satellites with which it communicates.
: **currently_obstructed** : Most recent sample value. See *obstructed* in
    bulk history data for detail. This item still appears to be reported by
    the user terminal despite no longer appearing in the bulk history data.
: **seconds_obstructed** : The amount of time within the history buffer,
    in seconds, that the user terminal determined to be obstructed, regardless
    of whether or not packets were able to be transmitted or received.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides this data.
: **obstruction_duration** : Average consecutive time, in seconds, the user
    terminal has detected its signal to be obstructed for a period of time
    that it considers "prolonged", or None if no such obstructions were
    recorded.
: **obstruction_interval** : Average time, in seconds, between the start of
    such "prolonged" obstructions, or None if no such obstructions were
    recorded.
: **direction_azimuth** : Azimuth angle, in degrees, of the direction in which
    the user terminal's dish antenna is physically pointing. Note that this
    generally is not the exact direction of the satellite with which the user
    terminal is communicating.
: **direction_elevation** : Elevation angle, in degrees, of the direction in
    which the user terminal's dish antenna is physically pointing.
: **is_snr_above_noise_floor** : Boolean indicating whether or not the dish
    considers the signal to noise ratio to be above some minimum threshold for
    connectivity, currently 3dB.

Obstruction detail status data
------------------------------
This group holds additional detail regarding the specific areas the user
terminal has determined to be obstructed.

: **wedges_fraction_obstructed** : A 12 element sequence. Each element
    represents a 30 degree wedge of area and its value indicates the fraction
    of area (time?) within that wedge that the user terminal has determined to
    be obstructed between it and the satellites with which it communicates.
    The values are expressed as a fraction of total, not a fraction of the
    wedge, so max value for each element should be something like 1/12, but
    may vary from wedge to wedge if they are weighted differently. The first
    element in the sequence represents the wedge that spans exactly North to
    30 degrees East of North, and subsequent wedges rotate 30 degrees further
    in the same direction. (It's not clear if this will hold true at all
    latitudes.)
: **raw_wedges_fraction_obstructed** : A 12 element sequence. Wedges
    presumably correlate with the ones in *wedges_fraction_obstructed*, but
    the exact relationship is unknown. The numbers in this one are generally
    higher and may represent fraction of the wedge, in which case max value
    for each element should be 1.
: **valid_s** : It is unclear what this field means exactly, but it appears to
    be a measure of how complete the data is that the user terminal uses to
    determine obstruction locations.

See also *fraction_obstructed* in general status data, which should equal the
sum of all *wedges_fraction_obstructed* elements.

Alert detail status data
------------------------
This group holds the current state of each individual alert reported by the
user terminal. Note that more alerts may be added in the future. See also
*alerts* in the general status data for a bit field combining them if you
need a set of fields that will not change size in the future.

Descriptions on these are vague due to them being difficult to confirm by
their nature, but the field names are pretty self-explanatory.

: **alert_motors_stuck** : Alert corresponding with bit 0 (bit mask 1) in
    *alerts*.
: **alert_thermal_shutdown** : Alert corresponding with bit 1 (bit mask 2) in
    *alerts*.
: **alert_thermal_throttle** : Alert corresponding with bit 2 (bit mask 4) in
    *alerts*.
: **alert_unexpected_location** : Alert corresponding with bit 3 (bit mask 8)
    in *alerts*.
: **alert_mast_not_near_vertical** : Alert corresponding with bit 4 (bit mask
    16) in *alerts*.
: **alert_slow_ethernet_speeds** : Alert corresponding with bit 5 (bit mask
    32) in *alerts*.
: **alert_roaming** : Alert corresponding with bit 6 (bit mask 64) in *alerts*.
: **alert_install_pending** : Alert corresponding with bit 7 (bit mask 128) in
    *alerts*.
: **alert_is_heating** : Alert corresponding with bit 8 (bit mask 256) in
    *alerts*.

General history data
--------------------
This set of fields contains data relevant to all the other history groups.

The sample interval is currently 1 second.

: **samples** : The number of samples analyzed (for statistics) or returned
    (for bulk data).
: **end_counter** : The total number of data samples that have been written to
    the history buffer since reboot of the user terminal, irrespective of
    buffer wrap.  This can be used to keep track of how many samples are new
    in comparison to a prior query of the history data.

Bulk history data
-----------------
This group holds the history data as-is for the requested range of
samples, just unwound from the circular buffers that the raw data holds.
It contains some of the same fields as the status info, but instead of
representing the current values, each field contains a sequence of values
representing the value over time, ending at the current time.

: **pop_ping_drop_rate** : Fraction of lost ping replies per sample.
: **pop_ping_latency_ms** : Round trip time, in milliseconds, during the
    sample period, or None if a sample experienced 100% ping drop.
: **downlink_throughput_bps** : Download usage during the sample period
    (actual, not max available), in bits per second.
: **uplink_throughput_bps** : Upload usage during the sample period, in bits
    per second.
: **snr** : Signal to noise ratio during the sample period.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides this data.
: **scheduled** : Boolean indicating whether or not a satellite was scheduled
    to be available for transmit/receive during the sample period.  When
    false, ping drop shows as "No satellites" in Starlink app.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides this data.
: **obstructed** : Boolean indicating whether or not the user terminal
    determined the signal between it and the satellite was obstructed during
    the sample period. When true, ping drop shows as "Obstructed" in the
    Starlink app.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides this data.

There is no specific data field in the raw history data that directly
correlates with "Other" or "Beta downtime" in the Starlink app (or whatever it
gets renamed to after beta), but empirical evidence suggests any sample where
*pop_ping_drop_rate* is 1, *scheduled* is true, and *obstructed* is false is
counted as "Beta downtime".

Note that neither *scheduled*=false nor *obstructed*=true necessarily means
packet loss occurred. Those need to be examined in combination with
*pop_ping_drop_rate* to be meaningful.

General ping drop history statistics
------------------------------------
This group of statistics characterize the packet loss (labeled "ping drop" in
the field names of the Starlink gRPC service protocol) in various ways.

: **total_ping_drop** : The total amount of time, in sample intervals, that
    experienced ping drop.
: **count_full_ping_drop** : The number of samples that experienced 100% ping
    drop.
: **count_obstructed** : The number of samples that were marked as
    "obstructed", regardless of whether they experienced any ping
    drop.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides the data from which
    this was calculated.
: **total_obstructed_ping_drop** : The total amount of time, in sample
    intervals, that experienced ping drop in samples marked as "obstructed".
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides the data from which
    this was calculated.
: **count_full_obstructed_ping_drop** : The number of samples that were marked
    as "obstructed" and that experienced 100% ping drop.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides the data from which
    this was calculated.
: **count_unscheduled** : The number of samples that were not marked as
    "scheduled", regardless of whether they experienced any ping drop.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides the data from which
    this was calculated.
: **total_unscheduled_ping_drop** : The total amount of time, in sample
    intervals, that experienced ping drop in samples not marked as
    "scheduled".
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides the data from which
    this was calculated.
: **count_full_unscheduled_ping_drop** : The number of samples that were not
    marked as "scheduled" and that experienced 100% ping drop.
    **OBSOLETE**: The user terminal no longer provides the data from which
    this was calculated.

Total packet loss ratio can be computed with *total_ping_drop* / *samples*.

Ping drop run length history statistics
---------------------------------------
This group of statistics characterizes packet loss by how long a
consecutive run of 100% packet loss lasts.

: **init_run_fragment** : The number of consecutive sample periods at the
    start of the sample set that experienced 100% ping drop. This period may
    be a continuation of a run that started prior to the sample set, so is not
    counted in the following stats.
: **final_run_fragment** : The number of consecutive sample periods at the end
    of the sample set that experienced 100% ping drop. This period may
    continue as a run beyond the end of the sample set, so is not counted in
    the following stats.
: **run_seconds** : A 60 element sequence. Each element records the total
    amount of time, in sample intervals, that experienced 100% ping drop in a
    consecutive run that lasted for (index + 1) sample intervals (seconds).
    That is, the first element contains time spent in 1 sample runs, the
    second element contains time spent in 2 sample runs, etc.
: **run_minutes** : A 60 element sequence. Each element records the total
    amount of time, in sample intervals, that experienced 100% ping drop in a
    consecutive run that lasted for more that (index + 1) multiples of 60
    sample intervals (minutes), but less than or equal to (index + 2)
    multiples of 60 sample intervals. Except for the last element in the
    sequence, which records the total amount of time in runs of more than
    60*60 samples.

No sample should be counted in more than one of the run length stats or stat
elements, so the total of all of them should be equal to
*count_full_ping_drop* from the ping drop stats.

Samples that experience less than 100% ping drop are not counted in this group
of stats, even if they happen at the beginning or end of a run of 100% ping
drop samples. To compute the amount of time that experienced ping loss in less
than a single run of 100% ping drop, use (*total_ping_drop* -
*count_full_ping_drop*) from the ping drop stats.

Ping latency history statistics
-------------------------------
This group of statistics characterizes latency of ping request/response in
various ways. For all non-sequence fields and most sequence elements, the
value may report as None to indicate no matching samples. The exception is
*load_bucket_samples* elements, which report 0 for no matching samples.

The fields that have "all" in their name are computed across all samples that
had any ping success (ping drop < 1). The fields that have "full" in their
name are computed across only the samples that have 100% ping success (ping
drop = 0). Which one is more interesting may depend on intended use. High rate
of packet loss appears to cause outlier latency values on the high side. On
the one hand, those are real cases, so should not be dismissed lightly. On the
other hand, the "full" numbers are more directly comparable to sample sets
taken over time.

: **mean_all_ping_latency** : Weighted mean latency value, in milliseconds, of
    all samples that experienced less than 100% ping drop. Values are weighted
    by amount of ping success (1 - ping drop).
: **deciles_all_ping_latency** : An 11 element sequence recording the weighted
    deciles (10-quantiles) of latency values, in milliseconds, for all samples
    that experienced less that 100% ping drop, including the minimum and
    maximum values as the 0th and 10th deciles respectively. The 5th decile
    (at sequence index 5) is the weighted median latency value.
: **mean_full_ping_latency** : Mean latency value, in milliseconds, of samples
    that experienced no ping drop.
: **deciles_full_ping_latency** : An 11 element sequence recording the deciles
    (10-quantiles) of latency values, in milliseconds, for all samples that
    experienced no ping drop, including the minimum and maximum values as the
    0th and 10th deciles respectively. The 5th decile (at sequence index 5) is
    the median latency value.
: **stdev_full_ping_latency** : Population standard deviation of the latency
    value of samples that experienced no ping drop.

Loaded ping latency statistics
------------------------------
This group of statistics attempts to characterize latency of ping
request/response under various network load conditions. Samples are grouped by
total (down+up) bandwidth used during the sample period, using a log base 2
scale. These groups are referred to as "load buckets" below. The first bucket
in each sequence represents samples that use less than 1Mbps (millions of bits
per second). Subsequent buckets use more bandwidth than that covered by prior
buckets, but less than twice the maximum bandwidth of the immediately prior
bucket. The last bucket, at sequence index 14, represents all samples not
covered by a prior bucket, which works out to any sample using 8192Mbps or
greater. Only samples that experience no ping drop are included in any of the
buckets.

This group of fields should be considered EXPERIMENTAL and thus subject to
change without regard to backward compatibility.

Note that in all cases, the latency values are of "ping" traffic, which may be
prioritized lower than other traffic by various network layers. How much
bandwidth constitutes a fully loaded network connection may vary over time.
Buckets with few samples may not contain statistically significant latency
data.

: **load_bucket_samples** : A 15 element sequence recording the number of
    samples per load bucket. See above for load bucket partitioning.
    EXPERIMENTAL.
: **load_bucket_min_latency** : A 15 element sequence recording the minimum
    latency value, in milliseconds, per load bucket. EXPERIMENTAL.
: **load_bucket_median_latency** : A 15 element sequence recording the median
    latency value, in milliseconds, per load bucket. EXPERIMENTAL.
: **load_bucket_max_latency** : A 15 element sequence recording the maximum
    latency value, in milliseconds, per load bucket. EXPERIMENTAL.

Bandwidth usage history statistics
----------------------------------
This group of statistics characterizes total bandwidth usage over the sample
period.

: **download_usage** : Total number of bytes downloaded to the user terminal
    during the sample period.
: **upload_usage** : Total number of bytes uploaded from the user terminal
    during the sample period.
